    - Single Server
    - Application & DB servers separation
    - Load balancers + multiple application servers
    - DB Replication
    - Cache
    - CDN:
        - Points of presence, or PoPs
        - Caching & static data like images, videos etc.
    - Data center
    - Messaging queue like Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc
        - Brings async nature in application
    - Database Scaling
        - Vertical:
            - We increase db capabilities like RAM, CPU, etc
        - Horizontal:
            - We can add more nodes with same or different capacities
            - Implementation: Sharding
                - Horizontal:
                    - Divide into multiple tables(row-wise segregation)
                    - Eg: Name-wise sharding like A-P: S1 & Q-Z: S2
                - Vertical:
                    - Divide into multiple tables(column-wise segregation)
