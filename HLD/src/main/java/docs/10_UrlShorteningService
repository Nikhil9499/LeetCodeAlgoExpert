Problem:
    - Design a system that will generate a tiny url for a long url

Requirements gathering:
    - Functional requirements:
        - What should be the length of the short URL ?
            - As small as possible
        - What will be the traffic(QPS) ?
            - 10M per day
        - For how many years we need to support this service ?
            - 100 years
        - What characters should we use for id generation ?
            - 0-9, a-z, A-Z (62 chars)
        - Extras: Good to have
            - Should we need to store any metrics as well like
                - how many times a url is getting clicked
                - custom short url support
                - geography from where people come from(Ip address)
                    - this will be important in deciding primary data-centers
                - kinds of devices used (contestant-agents)
                - request will have some useful headers like Ip address, contestant-agents, platform, etc

    - Non-functional requirements:
        - Very low latency
        - Very high availability

BoE Estimation:
    - Request per day = 10 M
    - Request per year = 365 * 10 M = 3650 M
    - Request in 100 years = 100 * 3650 M = 365 Billion

    - No. of chars = 62
    - For   len = 1, combinations = 62^1 = 62
            len = 2, combinations = 62^2 ~ 4k
            len = 3, combinations = 62^3 ~ 250 K
            len = 4, combinations = 62^4 ~ 15 M
            len = 5, combinations = 62^5 ~ 916 M
            len = 6, combinations = 62^6 ~ 56 B
            len = 7, combinations = 62^7 ~ 3.6 T => This will solve our use-case
            len = 8, combinations = 62^8 ~ 218 T
    - So minimum length required = 7

Design Discussion:
    - In order to generate unique ids of len 7 for every request, we can consider below options to start with
        - Hashing algorithms
            - We will hash the long url.
            - MD5:
                - It has a length of 128 bits ~ 128/8 bytes = 16 bytes = 32 hex-digits (1 hex-digit can be represented in 4 bits ~ 0.5 bytes)
                - So in order to use this we have to trim after length 7 which will result in collisions
            - SHA-1:
                - It has a length of 160 bits ~ 160/8 bytes = 20 bytes = 40 hex-digits (1 hex-digit can be represented in 4 bits ~ 0.5 bytes)
                - So in order to use this we have to trim after length 7 which will result in collisions

            - Because of above reason, we can't use hashing algorithms.


        - Base62 encoding:
            - We will encode the long url.
            - In this approach we get the problem of length criteria & creating unique id for each request.
                - Length issue:
                    - We can fix the length issue by padding it with '=' to get minimum length

                - UniqueId generator:
                    - check unique id generator design & discussion

        - Check design image

    - Flow:
        - Clients hit with longUrl as a param
        - LB will have rate-limiting algorithms to safe app-servers from DoS attack & forward the request to the servers
        - Application servers will check whether it has some value from range left or not,
            - If not, it will ask zookeeper to give it another range of unique numbers
        - Now, application servers will return a unique id to app servers and servers will encode it using Base62 encoding
            and add padding if necessary
        - Finally servers will save the shortUrl in the cache and in the database along with longUrl and return it to client as well

        - When clients hit shortUrl, servers first check cache for its presence
            - cache hit, servers directly redirect shortUrl to the longUrl
            - cache miss, servers hit db and fetch the longUrl, saves it in the cache and redirects to the longUrl
        - For analytics, redirection 302 is required.
            - Redirection 301 means that the requested URL has "PERMANENTLY" moved to the long URL, so browser caches it
                & subsequent calls won't come to our servers at all.
            -  Redirection 302 means that the requested URL has "TEMPORARILY" moved to the long URL, so browser doesn't cache
                it & subsequent calls come to our url shortening servers.

    Design 2: Check picture
    - For 3.5 T or more, Mysql will start facing some issues and we probably need to shard the data, so
        it's better to go with Cassandra.
        - Trillions of records adds size (often significantly) to databases, can hurt performance,
            and may lead to questions about maintaining billion-record MySQL instances.

    - Analytics:
        - Request will have some useful headers like Ip address, contestant-agents, platform, etc that we can use for analytics
        - We can send each request metadata to kafka but this will increase latency
        - We can do this asynchronously so that latency doesn't take any hit but some events might be lost
        - We can store request metadata in in-memory queue and flush to kafka after either a fixed time interval or
            when the in-memory queue is full
        - Flush will be done by some cron job or consumer in the background.
        - Token service will be backed by rdbms. Scaling this service is not an issue because we can do
            horizontal scaling very easily.
        - We are using RDBMS so that we can use it's transactional property to avoid collisions.
        - RDBMS schema:
            - unique_range: id, unique_id_range, isAvailable
            - Query: select unique_id_range from unique_range where isAvailable = true limit 1;
