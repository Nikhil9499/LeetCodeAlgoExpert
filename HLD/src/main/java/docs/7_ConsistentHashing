Consistent Hashing:
    - Consistent Hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects
        in a distributed hash table by assigning them a position on an abstract circle, or hash ring.
    - This allows servers and objects to scale without affecting the overall system.
    - It solves the problem of VARIABLE servers count & re-balancing of keys.
    - It leads to minimum re-balancing of keys = (1/n)% of keys re-balancing to the max.

    - Explanation:
        - It places all servers & all keys on virtual ring by using hash functions
        - In clockwise direction, we serve the requests. The closest server in clockwise serves the requests.
        - Hash functions used by server and keys positioning may or may not be the same.

    - Problem & Solution with Consistent Hashing:
        - If the hash function doesn't distribute the servers evenly, we will get uneven load on servers
            - Use virtual node concept,i.e, keep servers at different virtual points using different hash functions
            - Having multiple points of same servers will distribute load evenly.
