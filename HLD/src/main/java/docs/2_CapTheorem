CAP Theorem:
--------------

- Desirable property of distributed system(DS) with replicated data(RD).
- C = Consistency
- A = Availability
- P = Partition Tolerance
- Achieving all three, i.e, CAP, is not possible in DS with RD.

Follow the attached diagram to understand better.

Why CAP is not possible ?
- Assuming 2 variables, i.e, a=5 & d=2.

- AP system:
    - Suppose the communication breaks between DB nodes, i.e, node B & C.
    - Now, if any write request comes consistency will be compromised.
    - Let us assume, node B receives write request(make a = 6). Node B will update it to a=6 but node C still has the previous value of a , i.e, a=5.
    - Due to above reasoning, consistency gets compromised but system is available and partition tolerant.

- CP system:
    - Suppose the communication breaks between DB nodes, i.e, node B & C.
    - Now, if any write request comes consistency will be compromised but we need to maintain it somehow.
    - So we will turn down node C till the system has partition.
    - Imagine in diagram that node C has been turned down so any request routed to node C for data will get rejected or throw error.
    - Due to above reasoning, availability gets compromised but system is consistent and partition tolerant.

- CA system:
    - Suppose the communication breaks between DB nodes, i.e, node B & C.
    - Now, if any write request comes consistency will be compromised but we need to maintain it somehow.
    - So we will turn down node C till the system has partition.
    - But shutting down node C will compromise availability but we need to maintain this as well somehow.
    - The only solution in this case is to turn/shut off the whole system till the partition exists.
    - No requests will be served during this time.
    - If system has partitions, it won't have consistency & availability simultaneously.

- As we have seen that Partition(P) is something that we can't escape from in DS with RD so the only solution that is left
    is to either go with CP or AP because turning the whole system down is not at all accepted in DS.
