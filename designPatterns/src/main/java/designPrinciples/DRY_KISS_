1. DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
    - It means that you should not re-write the same piece of code again.
    - Instead your design should be such that you can always re-use the same code again in future, if needed.

2. KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
    - It is a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible.
    - Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a systemâ€”as simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of contestant acceptance and interaction.
