Before clouds:
    - Whenever we have to launch a new website, we need to buy stack of servers to host our website.
        => setup is expensive
    - Buying all these servers is very expensive.
    - Due to varying traffic, we might need to scale up our servers
        => buying more servers => more money
        => Also, most of the time our servers will sit idle doing nothing but it is still costing us the money.
    - Maintenance and monitoring of servers.
    - Security
    - We might end up focussing on server side more instead of business.
    - Nowadays, incoming data is very huge and it's not possible to save everything in normal db
        => End up buying larger db => more money
        => More need of space is there

What is cloud ?
    - Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to contestants through the internet.
    - There are three main types of as-a-Service solutions: IaaS(Infrastructure as a service), PaaS(Platform as a service), and SaaS(Software as a service).
    - Huge space available on internet where you can store data, host website, etc.
    - Read more at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-iaas-paas-and-saas/
    - It made sure that contestants are able to orchestrate their resources efficiently.
    - One can rent services and pay only for what is required.
    - Things like maintenance, monitoring, security, etc of servers are handled by 3rd-parties(those who are offering services for rent)
    - Because of above reason, we can completely focus oon business.

What is cloud computing ?
    - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over
        the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

    - Service Models: Check pic
        - SaaS: Software as a Service
            - 3rd party owned services and they rent/leases out to its clients for use and charge them based on their usage.
            - Software is maintained by 3rd party and clients are only using it and paying 3rd parties based on their usage.
            - Eg: Google offers gmail and charges clients, workspan offers CRM to clients and charges them, etc...

        - PaaS: Platform as a Service
            - It is a service where a third-party provider provides both software and hardware tools to the cloud computing.
            - The tools which are provided are used by developers.
            - Abstract contestant form underlying OS, middlewares, etc.

        - Iaas: Infrastructure as a Service
            - The complete infra is provided to the contestant for building & deploying the application
            - User don't have to worry about the physical machines being used behind the scenes
            - Abstract the contestant from physical machine involved for infra.

    - Deployment Models: Types of clouds
        - Public:
            - Service provider makes resources such as applications and storage for general public available over the internet
            - Easy set up
            - No resource wastage because we pay for what we use
            - Eg: CLoud storage space provided by gmail, etc

        - Private:
            - Same as public but it is behind a firewall
            - Provides security and used by companies to secure its data

        - Hybrid:
            - Mix of private and public models

    - Cloud Providers:
        - Amazon AWS
        - Microsoft Azure
        - Google Cloud Platform
        - Digital Ocean
        - IBM Cloud
        - Terremark

    - Introduction to AWS:
        - It is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, db storage,
            content delivery & other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.
        - Its compute power is 6x than other cloud providers compute power.

        - Use-cases:
            - Media company - store content
            - Architecture consulting
            - Manufacturing organisation - handles all infra, full focus on bisiness
            - Global reach - Training in large enterprises

        - Advantages/features of AWS:
            - Flexibility: Management of huge amount of data, deployment, etc
            - Highly cost effective: Provides free spcae for 1 year(free tier) and also paid services only for the time we are using.
            - Scalability: Easy to scale up & down => based on varying traffic, services are scaled accordingly.
            - Security: Provides security so we can focus on business.

        - AWS Architecture: Check pics 2.1 & 2.2
            - Regions:
                - Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide.
                - These locations are composed of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones.
                - Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area.
                - Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.

            - Availability Zones:
                - Availability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within each Region.
                - Local Zones provide you the ability to place resources, such as compute and storage, in multiple locations closer to your end contestants.
                - To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions.
                - Both the Edge Locations (EL) and Availability Zones (AZ) are AWS Data Centers,
                    but EL are primarily used for caching of the data to provide better contestant experience with low latency,
                    the AZ are used for hosting servers, websites, applications, software, Big Data processing, analytics and a wide variety of use cases.
                - AZ are big and few when compared to the EL. Also, the EL are closer to the contestant providing better latency when compared to the AZ.

        - Domains of AWS:
            - Compute: EC2(Elastic Cloud Compute) - clean slate - nothing is present.
            - Elastic beanstalk: Don't have to worry about underlying infra.
            - Migration: Move data from 1 DC to another. AWS SnowBall can be used.
            - Security & Compliance: KMS
            - Storage: S3, Glacier, CloudFront
            - Networking: VPC,
            - Messaging: SNS
            - Databases: RDS, Arora, DynamoDB
            - Management tools: CloudWatch

        - What is an instance ?
            - An instance is a virtual server for running applications on Amazon EC2.
            - It can also be understood like a tiny party of a larger computer,
                a tiny part which has its own hard drive, network connection, oS, etc.
            - But it is actually all virtual.
            - Different applications are required for Mac, Windows, other OSs and run those applications
                on servers with different space required. So we can't have different hardware for diff
                applications. Solution is instance.
            - System on top of which we have parts each part is an instance - Virtualization
            - One such instance of that virtual env is an instance.

        - What is EC2 ?
            - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, EC2 is a web service from Amazon that provides re-sizable
                compute services in the cloud.
            - Pros: Scalable, Flexible, Cost efficient

        - Types of instances
            - General purpose instance: Require quick response but low cost. Eg: email system
            - Compute instances: lot of computation(more CPU). Eg: Analysing streaming data
            - Memory instance: Heavy in nature(more RAM). Eg: MultiTasking system
            - Storage instance: need to store huge data. Eg: Large sized application
            - GPU instances: heavy graphics rendering. Eg: 3D Modelling

        - EC2 Pricing Models:
            - On-Demand: instance will be available whenever we ask/need. Say hourly basis.
            - Dedicated: instances given to org so as to have security on data. Isolation need.
            - On Spot: its like a bid, say 10$ for an instance, if any instance is present
                it will be returned but the same instance price can increase after sometime so it will be
                taken away from you. Good if data is volatile.
            - Reserved: its like renting an apartment on a contract basis
                -> fix rent
                -> less cost since longer duration

        - EC2 instances based on their functioning:
            - Burstable: if I need cpu utilization of 20%, but suddenly traffic increases.
                this will bursts to 100% CPU. This is a good choice.
            - EBS Optimised: App in which data is processing at high speeds.
            - Cluster Networking: cluster of instances
            - Dedicated: Same as above.
